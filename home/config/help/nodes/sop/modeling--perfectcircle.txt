= Perfect Circle =

""" Form circle from selection. """

Generate circles from set of specified or unshared edges.

There is one selection type that node supports and it's closed selection without any endponts. If any other selection will be found, node will ignore it, apply effect to proper ones, and add warning to inform user that selection contains also other types of edge islands that are not supported by this node.
If unshared edges is toggled ON, node will ignore any group specified in edge group field. If selection contains many closed edge islands, circle will be created from each one separately.

Examples:

- example of unshared edges selection

- example of specified edge group selection

- example showing selection that contains couple other types of selection which are ignored

@parameters

== Filter ==

[Include:parameters--group#edgegroupinput0]

Use Unshared Edges:
	#id: useunsharededges
	Ignore group specified egde group and find and use unshared edges on geometry.

== Main ==

Radius Mode:
	#id: radiusmode
	Specify calculation method of circle radius.
		
	Default:
		#id: 0
		Just apply circle algorithm without applying any aditional radius calculations.
	Closest Point:
		#id: 1
		Find closest point of selection to center of circle and use distance between as radius.
	Farthest Point:
		#id: 2
		Find farthest point of selection to center of circle and use distance between as radius.
	Custom:
		#id: 3
		Specify custom radius value.
	
Value:
	#id: radiusvalue	
	Radius in world units. 2 * r = 1 Houdini unit.
	:note:
	Visible only when _Radius Mode_ is set to _Custom_.
